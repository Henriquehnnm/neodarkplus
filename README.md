# Neodark+

A refined version of the classic Dark+ theme for Visual Studio Code, with smoother contrast and carefully selected colors for a more comfortable coding experience.

Designed to be familiar, yet modern â€” Neodark+ keeps the essence of Dark+ while reducing visual noise and improving readability across all languages.
